Possible improvement to Engineer Role description on profile

I am an experienced Engineer that's been around the block a few times. Based on my skills I can be a Cloud Architect, a Data Engineer,
a Backend Engineer and a Solution Architect. In the Braintrust talent profile I am forced to pick just one. I am working on my profile and
in support of that cause I obtained two GCP certifications: Professional Cloud Architect and Professional Data Engineer.

I would like my profile to show that I reside in all these "role specializations" at the same time. For example, A client looking for say,
a Senior Backend Engineer, may see my published description as Cloud Architect and not be aware that I can fit the role he is looking for.

It is said that what a reader sees in the first few seconds of looking at a profile or resume forms a strong first impression. It'd be great if that
first impression encompasses what is actually possible regarding the roles I could play.

Would the product team consider making it possible to select multiple roles per profile?
